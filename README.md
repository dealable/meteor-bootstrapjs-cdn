Only Bootstrap JS via CDN for Meteor
====================================
Load only the JS file for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) via CDN for Meteor, with the CSS or LESS files.
This is a workaround for [Nemo64/meteor-bootstrap](https://github.com/Nemo64/meteor-bootstrap/issues/4) to enable [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) style customizations in Meteor..
